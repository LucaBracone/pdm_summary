\section{Introduction}
We are given a set of points $y_1, \dots, y_n$ and imagine they are
realisations of a random distribution $p(y)$.
We would like to know how $p(y)$ looks like.
A commonly used method is the following: suppose that there is a set of
possible random distribution functions $P(y)$ in which $p(y)$ exists.
Then we assume that there exists a set $\Theta$ and a function $\Theta \to P(y)$
which we call a \emph{parametrisation}.
Usually, $\Theta$ is a simpler set to study than $P(y)$.
Then, statistics is concerned with using the observed $y_1,\dots,y_n$ to draw a
$\theta \in \Theta$ such that $\theta \mapsto p(y)$ is as ``close" as possible
to the ``true" $p(y)$.

Unlike in the usual statistical context, we view the parameter $\theta$ as
being itself random with some distribution $p(\theta)$. We define the joint
probability of $y$ and $\theta$ as being a function $p(y,\theta)$ such that
\begin{align*}
	p(\theta)        & = \int p(y,\theta) dy      \\
	\text{and } p(y) & = \int p(y,\theta) d\theta
\end{align*}
Then we define the conditional distribution ``of $y$ given $\theta$" as
\[
	p(y|\theta) = \frac{p(y,\theta)}{p(\theta)}.
\]
Using this property twice we obtain Bayes' theorem which allows us to ``invert"
and obtain the distribution of $\theta$ given the observed $y$. Since we only
observe a finite number of $y$ this is only an approximate distribution, we
will talk about uncertainty later on.
\[
	p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(y,\theta)}{p(y)} = \frac{p(\theta)p(y|\theta)}{p(y)}.
\]
In practice, the factor $p(y)$ is nothing to worry about since we can obtain it by integrating away $\theta$ in the following way,
$p(y) = \int p(y|\theta)p(\theta)d\theta$.

\section{Graphical models}
We observe a set of points $y_1, \dots, y_n$.
In particular the covariance for these points $\cov(y_i, y_j)$ for $i,j = 1,\dots,
	n$ is unknown and not necessarily zero.
We would like to obtain estimates for $p(y_i | y_1,\dots, \cancel{y_i},\dots, y_n)$.
