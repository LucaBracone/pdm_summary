# Structure learning of bayesian multiple graphs

This repository contains various materials concerning my masters thesis at
EPFL.

* `euh-emm` is a rust implementation of expectation maximisation (EM) for the
  estimation of bayesian graphs, like how it was done in [Li & McCormick
  2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06970v3).
* `summary.tex` and `summary.pdf` are the files containing the thesis
